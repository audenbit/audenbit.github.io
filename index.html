      <p>
        I am just a normal high school student, interested in quite possibly
        everything. Trying to get into webdev though after putting it aside for
        two years. Follow me on my journey!

      <p>
        This website will be used a way to practice and implement my html
        learning experience, and as a way to showcase any projects. A lot will
        come on this website!
